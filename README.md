# Android web installer

This is an easy-to-use web installer for Android-based operating systems that runs entirely in the browser. It uses WebUSB, which is supported by Chromium and its derivatives, and kdrag0n's [fastboot.js](https://github.com/kdrag0n/fastboot.js) library for flashing. This allows it to work on computers and Android devices software with no additional software or command-line tools.
